Title: Approaches to identify Differential Rhythmicity
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Bharath Ananthasubramaniam
Maintainer: Bharath Ananthasubramaniam <bharath.ananthasubramaniam@hu-berlin.deu>
Description: This package identifies features that have altered rhythms 
    between two conditions, i.e., are differentially rhythmic. Hypothesis 
    testing and model selection pipelines classify differentially 
    rhythmic features into four categories. The pipelines are implemented as a 
    single function with customizations for microarray, RNA-seq or generic 
    (prenormalized) data.
